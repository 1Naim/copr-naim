# Nexus RPMs

Spec files for some stuff I packaged on a whim. You can find the prebuilt RPMs in [my COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/veilink/nexus-rpms/).
Supports last 2 latest Fedora versions and to an extent, OpenSUSE Tumbleweed.

Currently packaged stuff:
- [obs-vertical-canvas](https://github.com/Aitum/obs-vertical-canvas)
- [scx-scheds-git](https://github.com/sched-ext/scx)
